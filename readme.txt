Adds table editing buttons to a new, third row in the WordPress WYSIWYG editor.

== Description ==

Adds table editing buttons to a new, third row in the WordPress WYSIWYG editor.

A very light weight plug-in based on a slightly modified version of the table editor plug-in included with 
the full version of TinyMCE 3.2.7. Only includes English localization; please let us know if you would
like additional localizations added.

Note that this should not be used with other plug-ins that significantly alter the editor's default behavior.
It is intended to be a simple, light weight solution for editors who only want to add table management to
WordPress' included editor.

Hoping to add the ability to hide the new table editing toolbar with the "kitchen sink" option in a future 
update.


== Installation ==

1. Install easily with the WordPress plugin control panel or manually download the plugin and upload the folder 
`mce-table-buttons` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
