Adds table editing buttons to a new, third row in the WordPress WYSIWYG editor.

== Description ==

Adds table editing buttons to a new, third row in the WordPress WYSIWYG editor.

A very light weight plug-in based on a slightly modified version of the table editor plug-in included with the full version of TinyMCE. Only includes English localization; please let us know if you would like additional localizations added. Note that this should not be used with other plug-ins that significantly alter the editor's default behavior. It is intended to be a simple, light weight solution for editors who only want to add table management to WordPress' included editor.

The third, editor toolbar is hidden or displayed along with the "kitchen sink."

== Installation ==

1. Install easily with the WordPress plugin control panel or manually download the plugin and upload the folder 
`mce-table-buttons` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
